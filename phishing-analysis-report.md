# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## Sample Email Indicators

1. **Spoofed Email Address**: 
   - Appears as `support@secure-paypal.com` which is not an official PayPal domain.

2. **Suspicious URL**:
   - Hovering over the link shows it leads to `http://paypal-verify-login.com`, a phishing site.

3. **Urgent/Threatening Language**:
   - Use of fear tactics: “Failure to act within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension.”

4. **Spelling/Grammar Errors**:
   - Slightly awkward phrasing used, which is a red flag.

5. **Lack of Personalization**:
   - Message begins with “Dear User” instead of using your name.

6. **Missing Digital Signatures or Security Indicators**:
   - Real emails from PayPal often have security indicators like a verified sender badge.

7. **Header Analysis (Simulated)**:
   - Would likely show a mismatch between the return path and domain, another sign of spoofing.
